The [hack.lu](https://hack.lu/) team and [CIRCL](https://www.circl.lu/) announce the new hackathon.lu 2025 event. 

This 2-day physical Hackathon, held in Luxembourg on April 8th and 9th, 2025, focuses on the development of free and open-source software for cybersecurity. We aim to convene diverse developer groups to collaborate on complex programming challenges within key cybersecurity areas, such as information sharing, threat intelligence, network and system forensics, data mining, network and computer exploitation, and defense techniques. The hackathon's objectives include improving existing open-source security [projects](/projects/), enhancing interoperability and integration between different security tools, and driving the creation of innovative new solutions.

The hackathon will emphasize tackling complex challenges, whether by enhancing existing projects or creating new ones, with a focus on how in-person collaboration and interaction can help overcome specific obstacles. We encourage activities both before and after the hackathon to maximize productivity and ensure the event is a catalyst for impactful progress. We aim to foster collaboration with both existing and new projects while building stronger trust within collaborative groups.

Many [open-source security projects](https://hackathon.lu/projects/) will be at the hackathon, including the MISP Project, AIL Project, Kunai, Flowintel, Lacus, Lookyloo, Pandora, Vulnerability-Lookup, OISF and Suricata. If you'd like to join us or propose a specific project for the hackathon, feel free to [get in touch](https://hackathon.lu/practical/)!
