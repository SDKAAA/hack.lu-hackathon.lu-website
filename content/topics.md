## Topics and Projects at hackathon.lu 2025

A series of topics are available for Hackathon 2025, along with potential task ideas. This list will be regularly updated based on feedback and the [projects](/projects/) joining the event.

### Cyber Threat Intelligence

Explore innovative ways to collect, analyze, and share threat intelligence to enhance cyber defenses and facilitate proactive responses to evolving threats.

#### Task - Improve the visualisation of MISP taxonomies and galaxies and make it accessible to a larger community.

### Cybersecurity - Open Data and Open Datasets

Use and create open data and datasets to support cybersecurity research, training, and collaborative innovation.

### API and Tooling Interoperability

Focus on creating and improving APIs and tools that enable seamless integration and interoperability between different cybersecurity platforms.

### Mercator  

Work on auto-discovery and update of existing objects using the [REST API](https://dbarzin.github.io/mercator/api/).

#### Tasks  

- **Auto-discovery with nmap**: Scan the network to identify active devices and retrieve basic information (IP, open ports, OS fingerprinting).  
- **Update server configuration with SNMP**: Collect hardware and software information from discovered devices and update Mercator accordingly.  
- **Integration with existing inventory data**: Cross-reference discovered devices with existing inventory records to update or flag discrepancies.  
- **Automated tagging and categorization**: Assign tags based on device type, OS, and role in the network.  
- **Web UI enhancements**: Display real-time discovered devices and provide an interface for manual validation and corrections.  
- **Alerting for new/unexpected devices**: Notify administrators when unknown or unauthorized devices appear on the network.  

### Cybersecurity Education

Create and share educational resources (e.g. CTF challenges), training modules, documentation and workshops to advance knowledge and skills in cybersecurity.

### Policy and Cybersecurity
Improve open source toolings to support policies, regulations, and frameworks to address the challenges and opportunities at the intersection of governance and cybersecurity.
